Hi There!

It is time for our first view on common tools in RF-engineering. This time we are having a look at the Vector Network Analyzer. An essential tool in analyzing signal paths. This device distinguishes in that it is an active device (generating signals), and a measuring device at the same time. 
The use cases are many, but the core of it is to measure S-parameters.

## S-parameters
